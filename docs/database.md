# Database

## Connecting to your production database

The location of the sqlite database is kinda funny. The real location is in
`/data/litefs/dbs/sqlite.db`. However, during development you connect to it via
the fake filesystem managed by LiteFS so it can propagate any changes to your
database to all replicas.

So to connect to your database, you'll want to connect to it at
`/litefs/data/sqlite.db` in the deployed application. Because it is SQLite, you
cannot connect to it unless you're running a command-line session on the
machine. You can do this using `fly ssh console`. The Dockerfile simplifies this
further by adding a `database-cli` command. You can connect to the live database
by running `fly ssh console -C database-cli`.

To connect to the deployed database from your local machine using Prisma Studio,
you can utilize Fly's `ssh` and `proxy` commands.

- Run in one terminal the command to start Prisma Studio on your desired Fly app
  ```sh
  fly ssh console -C "npm run prisma:studio" --app [YOUR_APP_NAME]
  ```
- Run in a second terminal the command to proxy your local port 5556 to Prisma
  Studio
  ```sh
  fly proxy 5556:5555 --app [YOUR_APP_NAME]
  ```

To work with Prisma Studio and your deployed app's database, simply open
`http://localhost:5556` in your browser.

> **Note**: You may want to add `--select` to the `fly ssh console` command to
> select the instance you want to connect to if you have multiple instances
> running. Otherwise you could connect to a non-primary instance. The easiest
> way to determine the primary instance (because it can change) is to open your
> deployed application and check the request headers. One of them will be
> `Fly-Primary-Instance` which will tell you the instance ID of the primary
> instance.

## Migrations

Thanks to Prisma, we've got a great mechanism for handling database migrations.
Any migrations necessary are run (by the primary instance only) as part of the
deploy process. You can find this in the `other/litefs.yml` file.

We deploy to multiple instances at once and the way we deploy means we don't
have any downtime during deploys. However, to make this work, you do need to
make sure you can run two versions of your app at once. Specifically, you should
not deploy "breaking schema changes" to your app in a way that will break any
running instances. This is a pretty typical requirement for production
applications.

The basic idea is that you maintain support for any client that is currently
running. In Epic Stack apps that's normally just the currently running version
of the app. So you really only need to worry about "breaking schema changes"
whenever you deploy a new version, but you don't have to worry about avoiding
breaking schema changes for old versions of the app that are no longer running.

In practice, this means you should adopt a "widen then narrow" strategy for
schema migrations. This is a pretty common practice, but here's a simple example
of how this works (each step here is an individual deploy):

1. Widen app to consume A or B
2. Widen db to provide A and B and the app to write to both A and B
3. Narrow app to consume B and only write to B
4. Narrow db to provide B

So, let's say that today your app allows users to provide a "name" and you want
to change that to `firstName` and `lastName` instead. Here's how you'd do that
(again, each of these steps end in a deploy):

1. Widen app to consume `firstName` and `lastName` or `name`. So all new code
   that references the `firstName` and `lastName` fields should fallback to the
   `name` field and not error if the `firstName` and `lastName` fields don't
   exist yet, which it won't at this point.
2. Widen db to provide `firstName` and `lastName` and `name`. So the `name`
   field should be populated with the `firstName` and `lastName` fields. You can
   do this as part of the migration SQL script that you run. The easiest way to
   do this is to generate the migration script to add the fields using
   `prisma migrate` and then modify the script to copy the existing data in the
   `name` field to the `firstName` field (maybe with the help of VSCode Copilot
   ðŸ˜…).
3. Narrow app to consume `firstName` and `lastName` by only writing to those
   fields and removing the fallback to the `name` field.
4. Narrow db to provide `firstName` and `lastName` by removing the `name` field.
   So now you can remove the `name` field from the db schema.

By following this strategy, you can ensure zero downtime deploys and schema
migrations.

## Seeding Production

In this application we have Role-based Access Control implemented. We initialize
the database with `admin` and `user` roles with appropriate permissions.

This is done in the `migration.sql` file that's included in the template. If you
need to seed the production database, modifying migration files manually is the
recommended approach to ensure it's reproducible.

The trick is not all of us are really excited about writing raw SQL (especially
if what you need to seed is a lot of data), so here's an easy way to help out:

1. Create a script very similar to our `prisma/seed.ts` file which creates all
   the data you want to seed.
1. Run the script locally to generate the data you want to seed.
1. Create a "dump" of the seed database using the `sqlite3` command line tool.
   ```sh nonumber
   sqlite3 seed.db .dump > seed.sql
   ```
1. Copy the relevant bits from the `seed.sql` file into your `migration.sql`
   file (it will include create table/index lines etc. You probably just want
   `INSERT` commands).
1. Deploy your app and verify that the data was seeded correctly.

If your app has already applied all migrations, then the changes to the
`migration.sql` won't be applied (because prisma's already applied it). So then
you can run the following command to apply the migration:

```sh nonumber
fly ssh console -C "npx prisma migrate reset --skip-seed --force" --app [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

> **WARNING**: This will reset your database and apply all migrations. Continue
> reading if you want to avoid this.

If you have existing data in your production database and you'd like to seed it
with more data without performing a migration, then it's a bit more involved.

1. Backup your production database (lol).
1. Create a new database file (locally) with the data you want to seed.
1. Create a "dump" of the seed database using the `sqlite3` command line tool.
   ```sh nonumber
   sqlite3 seed.db .dump > seed.sql
   ```
1. Copy the `seed.sql` file to your production volume next to your database (via
   `fly sftp`)
1. SSH into your production server and run the following command:
   ```sh nonumber
   sqlite3 data.db < seed.sql
   ```
1. Verify that your production database has been seeded correctly. If it hasn't,
   then restore your backup (asap).
